If you have any problem about this work or dataset, please contact with Ziyi Ye at Yeziyi1998@gmail.com or Yiqun Liu at yiqunliu@tsinghua.edu.cn. We are very willing to help you with the usage of our public data and code and we really hope the related communities (i.e., BMI for search) can attract more attentions.

## Dataset
Please download the user study dataset from https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/d/afe41a6a30bb4a4bbca2/ and save it as "release/".
The dataset description can be find at "release/readme.md".

## Source Codes
All implementation codes are available in the "src" directory.
In order to follow the paper, we suggest to run the codes from source file with prefix "part0" to source file with prefix "part6".
Before running the codes, please check these issues: (1) install all requirements in "requirements.txt" (e.g., using "pip install -r requirements"); (2) download the user study dataset and unzip it as "release/".; (3) create a directory namely "results/" to save experimental results.
